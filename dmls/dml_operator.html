<p>This is an additional function that will help you</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p id='lines'>"SELECT * from companies WHERE Age=15;"</p>
        <br>
        WHERE clause helps you to select and filter datas that you want to show. In that case, you want to show
        all datas where in column named 'Age' is the value of 15. WHERE clause can be used on any function to 
        filter the data you want to pick. 
    </li><br>
    <li>
        <p id='lines'>"SELECT * from companies WHERE Age<=16;"</p>
        <br>
        The clause '<' and '>' and also '<=' and '>=' says that you set a limit for the data you want to show.
        Similar to the one above, it helps you filter datas that you want to pick. 
    </li><br>
    <li>
        <p id='lines'>"SELECT * from companies WHERE Age=16 AND Name='Andy';"</p>
        <br>
        The clause 'AND' and 'OR' helps you to give more than one criteria for the data you want to pick. AND
        helps you to give more than one criteria while OR gives you an option for which criteria should be applied.
    </li><br>
    <li>
        <p id='lines'>"SELECT * from companies WHERE Age=16+1;"</p>
        <br>
        In SQL, operators such as addition, division, multiplication, and substraction exists. Of course. 
    </li>
</ul>
